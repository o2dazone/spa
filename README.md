# Getting Started
You'll more than likely want to pull the files of this package down but not the actual git history, so run this in your Terminal
`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/o2dazone/spa.git application_name; rm -rf !$/.git`

Once you have everything pulled down, rename the directory, and cd into it. Run `npm install` and then `gulp watch`
